Jeroen’s own tools - dsutls\n\nHandy bit for installing the tools I’ve been playing with:\nsudo apt install cowsay rust-bat moreutils csvkit\nSome things I’ve found super useful: csvlook/csv2md, batcat (in book as “bat” but there’s a name clash when I install on 24.04), tee for pushing out intermediate results. And of course, I always forget “man” is an option because we have the internet now… and it turns out I can press “/” to search these pages! Probably other things that open in this reader mode! jq super useful when dealing with web data/API’s/config files. Literally never heard of the tldr command…\ncsvlook -I prevents type inference and formatting eg; of numbers (interpreted years as numbers and added thousand commas without this).\n\ncsvgrep for searching/filtering csv\njq for working through json keys\n\n$ &lt; wikimedia-stream-sample sed -n 's/^data: //p' |\n&gt; jq 'select(.type == \"edit\" and .server_name == \"en.wikipedia.org\") | .title'"

Also, the command line is absolutely the kind of thing that’s so well documented that AI will be brilliant at it but who cares about that.\nI like that he’s fairly casual about not explaining every flag, command and use in the book, you need to go look things up if you want details and that’s always a good learning mechanism.\nThere are definitely tools in here I’m going to abuse - curl, weirdly, I just find more elegant than messing with python requests, and coupled with jq and csv type tools I can write something that’ll just work in a lot of places (read: VM’s in Azure) without having to mess around with venv. I also love being able to turn csv into markdown tables though I bet that exists inside Python!\nI like that he uses Nano, I know clever editors based on keyboards and nothing but keyboards exist, and I will never have time to care. Actual typing is not the least efficient part of my day.\nI notice also that for applications for which tools already exist, the python version is more verbose (albeit possibly more readable? I’m not confident on that)\nThe continuous allowance for streaming data is really interesting also, not something I’ve ever had to consider as a “research” data scientist"

I’ve used the ugly but standalone (and free) GanttProject before, which nicely handles dependencies between tasks and produces functional output. It’s a good quick option.\nBut if I build it in Python I will have a tool I can easily point at different underlying data for each project I need one for.

This book is reportedly a bit special, with a reputation for turning people’s brains around and change their view of programming.

I suspect it’s a natural consequence of all modern companies accidentally becoming IT companies, whether they want to or not.\n\n\n\nShort version: While the actual text is very readable, the exercises were very much meant for people with a stronger background in maths. I studied a natural science, integration was considered a bit fancy. A lot of the (probably elegant) exercise questions in this book involve implementing some equation that would probably make perfect sense to me and be obviously relevant if I hadn’t spent my degree dripping acid on rocks to see if they fizzed.\nAs it is I was left staring at the question wondering if I’m supposed to care or if a “trigonometric identity” might just mean a triangle or something? Whatever. Thankfully our office’s tame wizard is well aware, and is able to help direct us to what we need to know and are meant to be drawing from sections and exercises. It’s also abundantly clear that this is a course textbook, meant to be drawn from by a teacher as needed. Knowing this is useful both in that it reassures me it’s ok to seek help and that I can occasionally skip an impenetrably mathematical exercise and lose nothing but knowledge of some weird and unusual number series.

Terminology I didn’t know I needed or thought I understood from general knowledge has been clarified as something more specific in CS (Computer Science), like the difference between a recursive algorithm and a recursive process.\nThe insight into what interpreters think of/about the code I write, and the numerous illustrations of how execution of a more complex program folds out into a tree-like structure of executed primitive operations, are both giving me a view of how computers work that I may have seen before but is now far more explicit, and stands in attractive contrast to the many hands-on high level tutorials on applications of programming to things like data analysis that pay little attention to what is going on below the level of Pandas’ methods.\nAt a higher level, there’s also been some good discussion and examples in the book of proper abstraction; building procedures to perform specific, higher level tasks that are clear and focussed enough that once defined, you can use those without ever needing to reconsider their internal workings. Abstraction and modular code are ideas that’ll be old-hat to most people, but the\nAnd of course, now I know some Scheme!
