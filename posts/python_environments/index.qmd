# Quick cribsheets for handling python environments through different tools

## Conda - for weird Gov environments that don't have much else

First creation:

```bash
conda create --name environment_name
conda activate environment_name
conda install numpy pandas pdfplumber ipykernel jupyter openpyxl  # installing like this out of laziness
conda env export > environment.yml                                # writing an environment file so I can properly restore it

```

To build the environment using the stored `environment.yml`:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml                     # recreate the environment described in that environment
conda activate environment_name                         # activate
```
