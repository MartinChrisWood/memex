Quick cribsheets for handling python environments through different tools

## Conda - for weird Gov environments that don't have much else

Creating it first time:

```bash
conda create --name environment_name
conda activate environment_name
conda install numpy pandas pdfplumber ipykernel jupyter openpyxl  # installing like this out of laziness
conda env export > environment.yml                                # writing an environment file so I can properly restore it

```

To build the environment using the stored `environment.yml`:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml                     # recreate the environment described in that environment
conda activate environment_name                         # activate
```


## Bonus:  renv (R)

```bash
install.packages("renv")           # Install environment manager
renv::init()                       # First run, create environment for project (current dir)
renv::activate()                   # Or activate after navigating to project
install.packages("readr")          # Install packages
renv::snapshot()                   # Store exact package configuration to renv.lock file
renv::restore()                    # Recreate environment from renv.lock file
renv::revert()                     # Revert environment to that specified in renv.lock file
```
