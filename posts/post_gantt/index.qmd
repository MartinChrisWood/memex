## What?

Code for generating Gantt Charts, pretty ones, in Plotly.

Read the original Plotly examples if you want to get started marginally quicker, and to see more examples of variants of these plots.
Mines got some extra plotly arguments and a *marginally* more complete pile of code at the end.

Uses Python, Pandas and Plotly.  The project has two logical components; creating a suitable dataframe representation of the tasks to
be completed, and plotting that. Simple!
Credit to [this Plotly guide](https://plotly.com/python/gantt/) for providing all the code I'm going to adapt.
The only real change I need is the ability to visualise dependencies between tasks.

[My repo for this](https://github.com/MartinChrisWood/ganttinize)

## Why?

Gantt charts are boring and I dislike excel intensely so I'm going to build this instead.
This is probably **not** the best approach.  The best approach would be something that integrates with your DevOps platform, but
I don't know any and am not currently working with one ;)

A second best approach would be dedicated software, there seem to be a lot of free Gantt chart generators available. I've used the
ugly but standalone (and free) [GanttProject](https://www.ganttproject.biz/) before, which nicely handles dependencies between tasks
and produces functional output.  It's a good quick option.

But if I build it in Python I will have a tool I can easily point at different underlying data for
each project I need one for.  Plus Plotly gives me scalable html output with mouseover text, which is pretty handy when there's a
lot of optional context to tasks.

## Creating the data

Script expects a csv file with columns to describe the tasks and their start and end dates.
I've added one for dependencies, but it's just a text column that gets displayed really.

|Task|Start|Finish|Dependencies|Resource|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|"Job A"|'2025-06-01'|'2025-08-20'||Bill|
|"Job B"|'2025-08-20'|'2025-11-28'|'Job A'|Ben|
|"Job C"|'2025-09-28'|'2025-11-28'|'Job A'|Bill|
|Job D"|'2025-12-01'|'2026-01-28'|'Job B'|Bill|
|"Job E"|'2025-12-01'|'2026-01-28'|'Job C'|Ben|


## Plotting using plotly express's [timeline]() method

```python
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.graph_objects as go

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd


# Load the data (see section above)
df = pd.read_csv("example.csv", dtype=str)

# Create the labelling for the task blocks (I want to see task dependencies)
df['Labelling'] = np.where(
    df['Dependencies'].isnull(),
    df['Task'],
    df['Task'] + ", Dependencies: " + df["Dependencies"]
)

# Order as I want plotted
df = df.sort_values("Start", ascending=False)

# Plot
fig = px.timeline(
    df,
    x_start="Start",
    x_end="Finish",
    y="Task",
    color="Resource",
    text="Labelling",
    hover_name="Resource",
    hover_data={"Resource": False, "Start": True, "Finish": True, "Labelling": False},
    title="Gantt Chart"
)

fig.show()
```
