## Saving files that Excel won't complain about

Deal with a lot of columns that look like integers but are actually ID columns that can have leading zeroes.

I also deal with a lot of human text with special characters, when saved in a csv file in UTF-8 as normal, Excel
often fails to detect and correctly render the UTF-8 formatting due to being generally terrible software.

How to save a file that excel will open, interpret and display correctly with these problems:

```python
import csv
import pandas as pd

df = ...

df.to_csv(
"data/output/20260129_UK_CAN_RoO_by_HS6.csv", 
quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC,                   # Quote all non-numeric fields in the output file, which forces excel to read as string
encoding="utf-8-sig",                           # An encoding that adds a UTF-8 BOM (Byte Order Mark) that tells excel the doc is in UTF-8
index=False                                     # Don't add a column for the index, only need this if your index is meaningless
)

```
